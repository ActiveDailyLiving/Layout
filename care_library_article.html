              <h2>Finding Time For Yourself As A Caregiver</h2>
            </div>
            <img alt="image" src="./assets/images/article_image.png"/>

              <p>
                Finding time to dedicate to yourself with no outside distractions is challenging enough during
                the best of times. But when you’re a caregiver—especially a “sandwich generation” caregiver 
                who is juggling work tasks with parenting and managing the care of an older loved one—spare time 
                might feel like a myth. The COVID-19 pandemic also blurred the lines between personal time and time 
                spent on outside responsibilities. When everything from work to school to hobbies was happening at 
                home, home no longer felt like a place for peace and relaxation for many. Self-care came secondary 
                to caring for the world at large in the face of a global crisis. And though the situation is 
                continuing to improve, those habits can be hard to break. Research shows that respite—a period of 
                time taken away from responsibilities dedicated to relaxation and relief—can reduce negative mental 
                health effects like burnout, stress and tiredness. Respite can also give you much needed moments to 
                focus on yourself during times when you’re overwhelmed by the needs of others.
              </p>
              <h3>Here are just a few ways you find time for yourself as a caregiver:</h3>
               <ul>
                 <li>
                   <span>Explore ARCH National Respite Network</span>
                   <span>
                      The ARCH National Respite Network and Resource Center was created to help caregivers locate 
                      respite and crisis care services. The ARCH Network can help you find more information on 
                      Adult Day Centers in your area, as well as care providers that can help support you and your 
                      loved one when you need a break.

                   <span>Reclaim relaxation spaces in your home</span>
                   <span>
                     During the pandemic, many people had to convert rooms in their home to offices, work spaces 
                     and school rooms for children attending classes remotely. Places that used to be dedicated to 
                     reading, exercise, relaxation or quiet time became associated with work responsibilities, 
                     which often made it hard to use the room for anything else.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                      If this happened to you, make an effort to reclaim a room you can go to for moments of privacy. 
                      Time your use of this room for when children or older loved ones are occupied with other tasks. 
                      Whenever you need a moment, go to this room to take a breath, meditate, listen to music, do a quick 
                      exercise routine, read a book or work on a personal project. Leave your concerns at the door and enjoy 
                      the time you have to yourself while it’s yours to have.

                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <span> Recognize that destressing can take simple forms</span>
                   <span>
                      One barrier many have to taking time for self-care is feeling they have no large chunks of time to give. 
                      But relaxation doesn’t have to mean a week vacationing in Florida or a three-hour trip to the cinema.
                      Destressing can involve whatever gives you a moment of peace, pulls you away from the source of your 
                      exhaustion and reenergizes you. A long vacation can certainly boost your mood, but so can things you can 
                      easily work into your everyday life. You can’t go to your favorite singer’s concert every day, for example, 
                      but you can watch performance videos on YouTube and set aside some time to listen to their new music.
                      If you feel like you can’t sacrifice even small windows of time, that is a sign that your current schedule 
                      needs to change. No one should be so overburdened that they have no time to spare on their own interests and wellness.

                   <span>Create a backup plan for when you need a break</span>
                   <span> 
                     There may be days when you can’t do everything alone, and that’s completely understandable. But before those days come, 
                     it helps to have a plan in place as to who’s going to step up and help you. Build a network of family, friends and services 
                     who you can reach out to when you need to. It can help to break this contact list down by tasks. For example, your loved one’s 
                     neighbor might be willing to help with errands, while a local transportation service may offer support in helping older adults 
                     to medical appointments.</span>
                     <span>
                      Most importantly, remember that your needs matter, too, and it’s not selfish to take care of yourself.
